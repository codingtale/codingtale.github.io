<a id="posts" class="anchor" href="#posts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MySQL inline query versus stored procedure comparison.</h3>

Simple query using group clause for 1 million records resulting in final
list of 27 records:
1st time taken => 0.43053775

Same query through Stored procedure:
1st time taken => 0.43341600

So in terms of time, first time they are very close.
Profiling comparison for both can be seen figure no_cache_comparison.png
where left one is simple inline query and right one is stored procedure
query.

There are some actions which are extra in the inline query:
1. freeing items
2. logging slow query
3. cleaning up

Running both second time retrieve data from cache taking
0.00048025 => simple query
0.00036625 => stored procedure

Profiling comparison for both can be seen figure cache_comparison.png
where left one is simple inline query and right one is stored procedure
query.

Here too there are some extra actions for inline query:
1. logging slow query
2. cleaning up

Taking into consideration the approximate equal timing of both the type of
queries and that on second time execution both use cache, there is not
much difference. But given the fact that stored procedures are compiled
and stored, will be efficient for the db.

Also considering
https://sachinkumaram.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/stored-procedures-advantages-disadvantages/,
the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, I think.
